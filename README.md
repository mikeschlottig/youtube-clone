# YouTube Clone

## Project Overview

YouTube Clone is a web application that mimics the layout and design of the popular video-sharing platform, YouTube. This project showcases a video gallery with a responsive layout, a navigation bar, and a placeholder for videos. The implementation makes use of modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and Font Awesome for icons.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-clone.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd youtube-clone
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html   # On Mac
   start index.html  # On Windows
   ```

## Usage

The YouTube Clone application is designed to be simple and user-friendly. When you open the `index.html` file in your browser, you will see:

- A navigation bar at the top including a hamburger menu, search bar, and sign-in option.
- A sidebar for main navigation links including Home, Trending, Shorts, and Subscriptions.
- A grid of video thumbnails that showcases different video titles and details.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS, providing a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Search Functionality**: While the search bar is implemented, it currently does not have backend functionality.
- **Styled Navigation**: The top and sidebar navigation features icons and labels for easy access to different sections.
- **Video Cards**: Each video is displayed with a thumbnail, title, and additional details such as view count and upload time.

## Dependencies

This project includes the following dependencies:
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used in the navigation and interface.

These libraries are linked via CDN in the `index.html` file, so no need to install packages through npm or yarn.
